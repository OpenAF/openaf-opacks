             What is SQLJet

             SQLJet is an independent pure Java implementation of a popular SQLite database management system.
              SQLJet is a software library that provides API that enables Java application to
              read and modify SQLite databases.

             SQLJet does not support SQL queries; there is an API to work with the database on a lower level.
